 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Tito's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 
  I embarked on my coding journey at the age of 15, initially diving into the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during my high school years. This introduction to web development ignited my passion for technology, inspiring me to pursue further knowledge and research on my own.
  
 In 2023, I took a significant step in my educational journey by enrolling in the Systems Engineering program at Universidad Fidelitas in Costa Rica. While my college curriculum provides me with a strong foundation, I'm not content with just the knowledge acquired in the classroom. I have a genuine love for continuous learning and enjoy exploring new horizons independently.

 I am excited to contribute to the world of technology, with my skills and passion driving me to create and innovate. Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the ever-evolving world of software development
